            <h2>Me, On the Internet</h2>
            <p>If your already here you probably noticed something I did and thought it was cool! YIPPPEEEE! If you want to see other cool stuff I made look at</p>

                    <p>Contains the source code of my least-broken projects over the last 3 years. Even <a href="https://github.com/CottageDwellingCat/TheOwlShed">this site</a> is on it!</p>

            <h2>My Babies</h2>
            <p>I'm working on a few projects that are a lot better known than me, so if you want a taste of what I can do check out:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <a href="https://mewdeko.tech">Mewdeko</a>
                    <p>Mewdeko is a <a href="https://github.com/SylveonDeko/Mewdeko">fully open source</a> discord bot I've been working on for over a year! It offers an exuberance rivaling the most expensive premium apps at no cost and only asks you file a half decent bug report when you break it in return.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <a href="https://cakeybot.app">CakeyBot</a>
                    <p>CakeyBot is a closed source, general perpose discord bot. It has a premium subscription that locks some non-essential features, but pays for cool stuff (like the icons on this page). The app, like every discord bot at this point, has had some questionable content in the past; but if you bring it up with cake he will let you fix it. A good example is when he was considering adding an ai-art feature to the bot. I brought up the ethical issues I and a lot of my friends had with it, and he agreed to not add it. Later he noted <q>i think it was pretty clear it was never my intention to upset or ignore those people, more so an oversight without realizing it was a problem to begin with</q></p>

            <h2>Me????</h2>
            <p>Hi, I'm me. I'm a queer, autistic, teen who likes coding and cats. I use <a href="/pronouns.html"><span class="FILLABLE_NO_STYLE">%fillpronouns%</span> pronouns</a>, and *love* headpats. I've been coding since the 5th grade, mainly in c# with a touch of html/js.</p>
