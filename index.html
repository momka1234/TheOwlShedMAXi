            <h2>Me, On the Internet</h2>
            <p>If your already here you probably noticed something I did and thought it was cool! YIPPPEEEE! If you want to see other cool stuff I made look at</p>

                    <p>Contains the source code of my least-broken projects over the last 3 years. Even <a href="https://github.com/CottageDwellingCat/TheOwlShed">this site</a> is on it!</p>

            <h2>My Babies</h2>
            <p>I'm working on a few projects that are a lot better known than me, so if you want a taste of what I can do check out:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <a href="https://mewdeko.tech">Mewdeko</a>
                    <p>Mewdeko is a <a href="https://github.com/SylveonDeko/Mewdeko">fully open source</a> discord bot I've been working on for over a year! It offers an exuberance rivaling the most expensive premium apps at no cost and only asks you file a half decent bug report when you break it in return.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <a href="https://cakeybot.app">CakeyBot</a>
                    <p>Cake is a closed source app I just started working on; It's the first time I'm working on a major project outside of the public eye, and the adjustment has been ,,, hard (hence why i'm wrighting this instead of adding features to it). Cake is known to stable, rarely going down for more than a few minutes during planned updates and with less bugs than lake of pure acid I would trust it to run a moon bases life support system!</p>

            <h2>Me????</h2>
            <p>Hi, I'm me. I'm a queer, autistic, teen who likes coding and cats. I use <a href="/pronouns.html"><span class="FILLABLE_NO_STYLE">%fillpronouns%</span> pronouns</a>, and *love* headpats. I've been coding since the 5th grade, mainly in c# with a touch of html/js.</p>
