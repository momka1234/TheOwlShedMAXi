                        Hey <span class="fizzy-name">Fuzzy :3</span>, I'm tired as shit and doing this while taking online PE. This is terrible and I hate it. I will be working on homework until like midnight at this pace. I really like the new verification thing, though. Today I heard about an encryption algorithm cops used that had clear security issues, but the makers of it refused to share the source code of it to let people discover the issues. This is funny because it's the standard to share that information, and the most secure algorithms all do. The issues where not hard to find, and they where only reported to the maker after many years of use. People probably managed to get around the restrictions.

                        AGSGDBDG i keep forgetting about the thing and also i dont really have a set date and also we forgot to do it last week (or maybe it was just that i forgot to do it last week(💀) but anyways yesterday(saturday) night i went to a cook-out with my mom's coworkers and it was very nice and silly and they live in like the middle of no where and it was very funky they kept like kindajoking about us moving there and honestly i wouldnt be super opposed like i think they main problem with moving for me is that with the one location we had picked out it was like new but in a bad way like the neighborhood annoyed me for some reason and like it wasnt new ENOUGH like also i would be way closer to the ick person (of whom i had the grossness with) and i do not like that and honestly i would be down for moving to an entirely new place with a new setting and new life and i could restart like that could actually be so fun tbh but also my parents were like "yeah no we're not gonna move actually, its too much work" so idk

                        Hey <span class="fizzy-name">Fuzzy :3</span>, it's Tuesday. Today I woke up at 6am and went on a bike ride into the sunset (litterally) It was beautiful, and there weren't a lot of people. I went along the river in city park, and saw wisps of fog rolling across it that made me think of you. When I got home I layed in bed next to my cat and she grabbed by arm and mewowed and proceeded to lick it for 20 minutes while I watched an episode of bobs burgers before class started. I also decided to write a song today! My familly will be out of the house for 3 hours so no one will hear my terrible voice. I can send it to you if you want. <br />

                        Hey <span class="fizzy-name">Fuzzy :3</span>, it's Tuesday (it's been a while, I know). A few quick updates:
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                I found what I thought was a weirdly large snail shell but found a real snail instead
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                I decided I will start posting on tuesdays, and, every time I miss a day I will eat a banana (this is just a me thing, because it's hard for me to focus if I don't have a reason to.)
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                I decided to start coding in light theme and it looks pretty nice!
                                <a href="files/new_theme.png" target="_blank"> <img src="files/new_theme.png" width="500px"/> </a>
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                        I also really enjoy swimming in the ocean, like I'm much more boyant than if i'm swimming in a lake. I can just lay sorta on my back and stay still and I float over a 2 foot wave. It's awesome.
                        <br />
                        one more thing, I have decided to sign off every post with:

                        Hey <span class="fizzy-name">Alkali</span>, it's Friday. We should open a Magical Item Cafe, like from little witch acadamia. We could sell Magical items you enchant, and I could fix peoples broken magical items.  We would have complimentry tea and pastries. Id have a little cat bed in the corner and wear a magical collar that turns me into the cat from that one thing you drew, and if I needed to work i'd take it off. People would pet me n when you went on walks I could sit on your shoulder. The store would look old and dusty but be filled to the brim with spell books and magical items, and we would both have all of them memorized. ALSO our basement would be the secret meeting place for the gay kinds of the local high school, and there would be an anxious witchy kid with 'no magic' who would like help out in our store in exchange for lessons on how to care for magical items. (their themed after me).

                        Hey <span class="fizzy-name">Fizzy</span>, it's Friday. I just finished the sun and the star, and want to tell you about how it feels to read a good book. When I read a good third person book, it feels like I have become the narrator. I am observant to the party and it's pain, I feel the emotions of every character. I cry as Nico is told by the souls that he does not deserve to live, and I feel terrified of the world and it's changes through the eyes of Nyx. The book I just read took my soul and my emotions and turned them into something else, for a moment. They have yet to recover their original state, and, at the moment I'm a gay wreck of a demigod. The relationship I have with my books feels closer than the one I am able to maintain with any human or animal. I can walk to my shelf and find stories of hope and life and wonder, of friendship and despair and trauma, or of systemic injustice and anarchism and dragons. With my books I am never alone and always loved, filled with the most powerful, truest feelings.

                        Hi <span class="fizzy-name">Fizzy</span>, have you smelled an old book recently? If not you should; I have a bunch in my room! They smell like vanilla, not a vanilla cake or vanilla <span class="onrac-without-the-rac" style="font-size: inherit;">cream</span> pie, but a special weird kind of vanilla book. The scent makes me feel calm and at home and content. It brings me back to my dad reading to me every night, and the long-outdated 'astronomers encyclopedia' in my first elementry schools library. I also am what my contemporaries call a 'goth', which, in theory, means I read too much for my social group. I would like to be gotheir (and recently got my first chain! YIPPPEEEE) and also read more old books from forgotton piles in libraries. I would also like a word for goths who like to read old books, but don't have any good ideas (<i>sad mews</i>). Someday 'goths-who-read-books' will dominate high school movies and you know it.

                        Hi <span class="fizzy-name">Fizzy</span>, it's Friday! I've really been enjoying watching Saiki K with you! All of the characters are so silly n so goofy n so cool n so fancy! I'm going to start reading the <a href="https://www.mangaread.org/manga/saiki-kusuo-no-sainan/chapter-1/">manga</a>, which i'm only 30% sure is malwhere /hj. Right now i'm really hot, not appearance wise (I look like a goose that just lost a pickle jousting a fight in a bar to a cicada) but temperature wise, even though I have a window open. It's really sad it's getting hot so early because I was finnally getting less annoyed at the spring weather stealing my beautiful winter. I think it's the correct time of year to retreat into my bedroom and not leave till september but I really like going to the park with you so I might make alternative plans.

                        Hi <span class="fizzy-name">Fizzy</span>, it's <em class="onrac-without-the-rac">Saturday</em> (bum bum bummmm) I spent the time I was planning on wrighting yesterday with <span class="fizzy-name">you</span> and forgot to make a post <em>*sad nyas*</em>. Anyway, enough with the bordem lets get some gay sex in here, and by gay sex I mean reasonably homosexual text. <br />
                        Right now I am in my bedroom and their are 4 sounds, there is a train in the distance (toot click click click), a cat (slurp slurp slurp), the wind in the distance (woooooosh wooooosh), and my keyboard (clack clank clank clack). Together the sounds make a snazzy calming vibe that I think is almost as cool as the cavetown music I'm going to fall asleep to later tonight. I want to see where the train is, and ask if I can go for a ride on it; and I want to pet my cat, I want to run up a hill into the wind with flours around; but the sound that makes me most excited is they keyboard clicks that make me think i'm going to talk to you soon. I hope you dream of happy cryptid kittens tonight. cya soon :3

                        i was thinking like its so goofy that language is such a big barrier to people, there's so many things that only WE can do, cus we speak english. you have to devote a whole like separate chunk of your life towards learning a language so you get access to stuff, i say that we should make a new language that everyone has to collectively learn so that we all understand eachother and there isnt miscommunication and no one is left out because of something they arent really at fault for (i mean, i guess you can blame someone for no making the choice to learn a language, but that's usually considered a pretty dicky move so like ehhh)

                        Hi <span class="fizzy-name">Fizzy</span>, it's Friday. As you know, for an evil scientist like myself it's important to hear your jingle at least once a day; it keeps the docter away, prevents scurvy, and even makes you smell bad to platypusses. But it can be hard to get your daily does of duely devious music. Now of course you could make the music your alarm sound or bribe someone to play it outside your house using an amplified tuba every day but the solution for me seemed to be a jingle inator. I instantly brought the concept before my crack focus testing team (of 12 year olds) who informed me that it sounded like the inator made people pee their lab coats; not willing to take the risk I began researching alternative means and found a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@doofenshmirtzevilinc12">Youtube channel</a> that plays my jingle once a day! Simply turning on notifications prevents scurvy ... and a four hundred and fifteenth rabies vaccination fallowing a platypus bite.

                        I love spiders, they're so silly. Like, what is it about those silly legs? And they have so many eyes?? And its equal and there eight legs and eight eyes and dajsdkshfdsjkhkjdfh They're so crawly goofy and aaaaaah anyways spider web by Melanie Martinez is a song about like being addicted to social media/wanting to leave social media but being bound with their communities and i love it and also just the metaphor of the web being the internet and its sticky and like spiders being the like celebrities or whatever (i don't entirely understand it but it's fun so yeah) ALSO LIKE THE MELODY LIKE 😩😩😩😩 IT SLAPS and yeah. I have been drawing spiders and tarantulas too much, like way too much, like all the time idk what to do about it anymore. There are spiders everywhere and I keep thinking they're moving and I get jumpy like what?? How am i scared of spiders but fixated on them like 💀 Anyways the entire album just hits so good like omg yeah anyways so arachnophobia is so funky like i definitely don't have it but still anyways.

                        Hello <span class="fizzy-name">Fizzy</span> (I made your name sparkle), today is an exciting day. Inspired by a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtyXbTHKhI0">series of vlogs</a> older than me, created by Hank and John Green (noted cool people on the internet). I have decided that, today, I will send a message to you, next Wednesday you will reply to that message, and talk about something exciting to you, and on Friday, I will return the favor. As long as your physically able to there is no way to dodge this queer shenanigan I have forced upon you. In order to avoid wasting time, we will each get only 200 words, unless we steal our message from something else we already wrote. In addition either of us can change any of the rules however we like, so long as the change is for the greater bad >:(((( ALSO I have nymphology stuck in my head now which is amazing until you realize that it's like not a song I can sing in the middle of a crowded park?? (a consistent problem for me) anyway be gay, and see you Wednesday!
