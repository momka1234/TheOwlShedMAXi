                        Hi <span class="fizzy-name">Fizzy</span>, it's <em class="onrac-without-the-rac">Saturday</em> (bum bum bummmm) I spent the time I was planning on wrighting yesterday with <span class="fizzy-name">you</span> and forgot to make a post <em>*sad nyas*</em>. Anyway, enough with the bordem lets get some gay sex in here, and by gay sex I mean reasonably homosexual text. <br />
                        Right now I am in my bedroom and their are 4 sounds, there is a train in the distance (toot click click click), a cat (slurp slurp slurp), the wind in the distance (woooooosh wooooosh), and my keyboard (clack clank clank clack). Together the sounds make a snazzy calming vibe that I think is almost as cool as the cavetown music I'm going to fall asleep to later tonight. I want to see where the train is, and ask if I can go for a ride on it; and I want to pet my cat, I want to run up a hill into the wind with flours around; but the sound that makes me most excited is they keyboard clicks that make me think i'm going to talk to you soon. I hope you dream of happy cryptid kittens tonight. cya soon :3

                        i was thinking like its so goofy that language is such a big barrier to people, there's so many things that only WE can do, cus we speak english. you have to devote a whole like separate chunk of your life towards learning a language so you get access to stuff, i say that we should make a new language that everyone has to collectively learn so that we all understand eachother and there isnt miscommunication and no one is left out because of something they arent really at fault for (i mean, i guess you can blame someone for no making the choice to learn a language, but that's usually considered a pretty dicky move so like ehhh)

                        Hi <span class="fizzy-name">Fizzy</span>, it's Friday. As you know, for an evil scientist like myself it's important to hear your jingle at least once a day; it keeps the docter away, prevents scurvy, and even makes you smell bad to platypusses. But it can be hard to get your daily does of duely devious music. Now of course you could make the music your alarm sound or bribe someone to play it outside your house using an amplified tuba every day but the solution for me seemed to be a jingle inator. I instantly brought the concept before my crack focus testing team (of 12 year olds) who informed me that it sounded like the inator made people pee their lab coats; not willing to take the risk I began researching alternative means and found a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@doofenshmirtzevilinc12">Youtube channel</a> that plays my jingle once a day! Simply turning on notifications prevents scurvy ... and a four hundred and fifteenth rabies vaccination fallowing a platypus bite.

                        I love spiders, they're so silly. Like, what is it about those silly legs? And they have so many eyes?? And its equal and there eight legs and eight eyes and dajsdkshfdsjkhkjdfh They're so crawly goofy and aaaaaah anyways spider web by Melanie Martinez is a song about like being addicted to social media/wanting to leave social media but being bound with their communities and i love it and also just the metaphor of the web being the internet and its sticky and like spiders being the like celebrities or whatever (i don't entirely understand it but it's fun so yeah) ALSO LIKE THE MELODY LIKE ðŸ˜©ðŸ˜©ðŸ˜©ðŸ˜© IT SLAPS and yeah. I have been drawing spiders and tarantulas too much, like way too much, like all the time idk what to do about it anymore. There are spiders everywhere and I keep thinking they're moving and I get jumpy like what?? How am i scared of spiders but fixated on them like ðŸ’€ Anyways the entire album just hits so good like omg yeah anyways so arachnophobia is so funky like i definitely don't have it but still anyways.

                        Hello <span class="fizzy-name">Fizzy</span> (I made your name sparkle), today is an exciting day. Inspired by a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtyXbTHKhI0">series of vlogs</a> older than me, created by Hank and John Green (noted cool people on the internet). I have decided that, today, I will send a message to you, next Wednesday you will reply to that message, and talk about something exciting to you, and on Friday, I will return the favor. As long as your physically able to there is no way to dodge this queer shenanigan I have forced upon you. In order to avoid wasting time, we will each get only 200 words, unless we steal our message from something else we already wrote. In addition either of us can change any of the rules however we like, so long as the change is for the greater bad >:(((( ALSO I have nymphology stuck in my head now which is amazing until you realize that it's like not a song I can sing in the middle of a crowded park?? (a consistent problem for me) anyway be gay, and see you Wednesday!
