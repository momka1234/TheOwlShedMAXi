            <h1>My friend wants computer recomendations</h1>
            <p>
                I want to make sure I give a good recomendation. I have the following information to base it on, and 
                don't have a budget, but will provide multiple options depending on his cost range.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>He wants to edit videos using Flimora</li>
                <li>He wants to use windows 10 or 11</li>
                <li>He wants to play 'some AAA games' on his computer, but presumably does not need perfect graphics</li>
                <li>He is ok purchasing a monitor separately</li>
            </ul>

            <h2 id="lnk-1">System Requirements</h2>
            <p>The most intensive program he will run will likely be his editor, filmora. for HD video it recommends:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>64 bit OS</li>
                <li>Intel 6th gen i3 or better</li>
                <li>16 GB of RAM</li>
                <li>non-ancient GPU with ≥4GB of VRAM</li>
                <li>SSD-drive</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Because he wants to play AAA games, he will need a lot of hardrive space, and a GPU with a touch more 
                VRAM, in addition he should have have TPM2 support for windows 11.</p>

            </table>
            
            <h2 id="lnk-3">What are Some Recomendations</h2>
            <p>I would recommend two different types of systems, fully desktop systems are generally cheaper for the power and are easier to upgrade but are not portable, and docked laptops which are harder or impossible to upgrade, and more expensive but portable.</p>
            
            <h3 id="lnk-4">Full Desktops</h3>
            <p>Lots of 'gaming' prebuilt desktops meet your specs, <a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/6533259.p?skuId=6533259">this one from bestbuy</a> is pretty good for price. You can get in 500GB or 1TB models, I personally recommend getting 1TB esp. if your dealing with video. If you want to see if you can make a cheaper compatable PC using custom parts there is a cool shop downtown that helps with that, or I can make a part list for you; thats a bit of extra work so I don't want to do it unless you want a custom computer. You can expect a desktop meeting your needs to set you back $800 to $1,500 depending on how fancy you get.</p>
            <h3 id="lnk-5">Laptops and Docs</h3>
            <p>Again with the gaming machines! Gaming laptops will meet your requirements a solid 90% of the time, just make sure they don't use Intigrated graphics (those are absolute shit for gaming, video editing, and using your computer in general). I found <a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/6504563.p?skuId=6504563">this one on bestbuy for $500 off</a>, and it looks like a great deal. The laptop itself will probably cost $1,200 to $2,000, in addition you might want a doc, which lets you connect your laptop to a monitor, keyboard, mouse, and charger at the same time through a single port. <a href="https://www.pcmag.com/picks/the-best-docking-stations-for-windows-laptops">This PCMag article has a good list of them</a>. Docking stations will cost between $100 and $150.</p>
            
            <h2 id="lnk-6">What About the Monitor??!!</h2>
            <p>I have a M24f and 23es. The 23es is probably ~5 years old now, and has no issues, and the M24f is larger which is nice, and refresh faster (yay!). Any monitor by hp (shameless brand loyalty I know) is probably good, but don't get one over $200 unless it has a special feature like a 4k panel or a 120Hz refresh rate. Check the number and variety of ports your computer comes with, for instance my computer has 1 HDMI and 3 DP ports, so I need a DP → HDMI converter to use a second monitor.</p> 
            
            <h2 id="lnk-7">After ya Get a Computer</h2>
            If you purchase a prebuild windows computer you will <b><i>ALWAYS</i></b> want to re-install windows to remove any weird nightmares that come preinstalled (like McAfee or hp support suites). After that you should:
            <ol>
                <li>Install all of the apps you want (firefox, filmora, etc)
                <li>Install softwhere updates & restart your computer
                <li>Decide on an antivirus: Windows Defender is normally fine but if your worried I recommend <a href="https://www.malwarebytes.com/">Malwherebites</a>
                <li>Enable ToTP based 2FA on your Microsoft account, <a href="https://authy.com/guides/microsoft/">This guide by Authy</a> explains how. It protects your computer against users gaining access using an insecure primary account.
            </ol>
