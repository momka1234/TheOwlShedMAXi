                    Goals for this site
                </h1>
                I want this site to be around for a while, to showcase my stuff and remind me of what I loved when I made it. To accomplish this I want to:
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Maintain the domain for the remainder of my life, and maintain hosting on the site.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Keep an active git history for every major subdomain (excluding cdn/library hosting/linking or other non-content pages)
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Reduce dependencies on other sites and host libdata on site whenever posable
                    </li>
                </ul>
                I want to make this site friendly and I want it to look cool to <i>me</i>. I don't and won't care if my site is widely considered pretty, and I will not support mobile devices.
                <hr />
                <h2>
                    Goals for myself
                </h2>
                In addition to my attempt to create a record of my life, and a place to express myself I also want a place to learn about web development and relationships and fandom, to do that specifically I want to:
                <ul>
                   <li>Work on other sites (like https://squll.net) that have other goals, technical requirements, and styles</li> 
                   <li>Join or create a webring</li>
                   <li>Collaberate with my in-person and online friends.</li>
                </ul>
                I hope to add to this page over time, because this project is ever shifting. See ya in the end times, and DFTBA
