                What is a broken me?
            </h2>
            <p>
                This is an amorphus and hard to define thing; in short, sometimes in stressful environments (like schools, friends bedrooms, and malls) I will "shut-down" and stop talking. Sometimes I will also:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Curl into a ball.</li>
                <li>Have muscle spasms.</li>
                <li>Cry (quietly or loudly, the choice is mine!)</li>
            </ul>
            <h2>
                What Should You NOT Do?
            </h2>
            <p>
                Broadly, TOUCH ME. While <span class="fizzy-name">cuddles</span> are really, really, really nice <b>most</b> of the time I find them really stressful when I'm "broken". Additionally asking me to do things, or to leave a place will scare me more. Please don't shout either; I can control it about as much as you can so expecting me to not have it happen is pretty dumb. 
            </p>
            <h2>What Should you do?</h2>
            <p>Talk calmly and gently. Ask if I want to go somewhere quiter and if I do lead me there, don't be forceful though. You could also do something on your own; like watch tictok read a book or just have a fun time.</p>
            <h2>I'm Unbroken, Should You do Anything Special</h2>
            <p>Broadly, nope. If you want to talk about it, cool. If you don't cool. Mby we could walk to gas station and get Dr.Peppers together</p>
