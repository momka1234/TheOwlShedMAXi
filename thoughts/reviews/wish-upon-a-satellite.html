                Wish Upon a Satellite is one of the best books I've read this summer. It combines a wonderfully described setting,  with well thought out and relatable characters. The story focuses on a non-binary child, named Ceil who I'm sure every visitor of this site will be able to find themself in. The book is tightly written with a perfect balance of tough emotions and humor, friendship and romance, and exploration and continuation. Reading it made me feel seen in ways I seldom do in any media. I <i>implore</i> you to check it out at your local library. <br />
